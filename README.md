## Usage Information

After installing the program, run it in your terminal using node.`node index`.  The program will begin by asking you what is your employee's role whose information you are entering in.  It will then prompt you to enter in their basic information such as name, ID #, and email address.  Each role also has specific questions or prompts related to that role.  For example, if they are a manager it will prompt an office number, for engineers, it will prompt a github link, and for an intern, it will prompt their school.  After entering each employee, the program will ask if you'd like to add another employee, once you select "no", it will begin generating the html file.
